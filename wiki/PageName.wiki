=Hey happy coders!= 

I know what my _tk15game_ have *BIG BAG* )) 
Simple sayin' if you cannot change places of 14 & 15, it mean you never do that. 
It's impossible/ 
In my code (help me with *Subversion* or *Mercurial* somebody for create nice repository) numbers mixed by *random*. 
It's TOTALLY wrong. 
That's all what I wanna say today, goodbye.
